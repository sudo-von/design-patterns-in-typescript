#### Interface segregation principle

* A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement.
* Keep classes and interfaces compact.
* Segregate = Split.

#### How to recognize the issue?

* You don't know how to implement an interface method.
* The interface method does not belong in the class.
* You are forced to leave the method empty.
