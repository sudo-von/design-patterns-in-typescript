#### Dependency inversion principle

INTERFACES!

* Your classes and modules should depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
* Abstractions = Interfaces.


* Wired = Port for wired
* Wireless = Port for wireless
* Touchpad = Port for touchpad
* Laser = Port for laser
* Optical = Port for optical
* Trackball = Port for trackball

Common interface = USB...
Common interface = An entity with two buttons and a pointer.
Implementation does not matter.
Loose coupling.
