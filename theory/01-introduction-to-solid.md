#### What does SOLID mean?

S = Single responsibility
O = Open/closed
L = Liskov substitution
I = Interface segregation
D = Dependency inversion

#### Single responsibility

* A class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality.

#### Open/closed

* Open to extension.
* Closed to modification.

#### Liskov substitution

* Also known as substitutability.
* You should be able to use a subclass in place of its parent class.

#### Interface segregation

* A class should not depend on methods that it does not need to implement.

#### Dependency inversion

* Your classes and modules should depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
