#### Object pool

* A pool of pre-initialized objects whose initialization is heavyweight.
* Every time we need such an object we take one from the pool.
* Once we are done with it, we return it back to the pool or destroy them.

#### Is the object pool deprecated?

* Still used in game development.
* It's used in combination with factory.
